mongoose
========

MATLAB-based library for data processing of the PSG2/Serpent and MCNP Monte Carlo reactor physics codes.  These
were developed on an as-needed basis with hopes of expanding them; however, my work with Serpent has come mostly
to a close, so I am sharing the scripts with the community.

Installation
========

These scripts can be set to the MATLAB path in the following manner:

Set the path to the partent directory containing +mongoose.

   - When you call a script you will use: mongoose.Serp_plot_data('.',2,opt)

Usage
========

Currently, some scripts will not function or are out of date.  I will expand on this as time allows.
